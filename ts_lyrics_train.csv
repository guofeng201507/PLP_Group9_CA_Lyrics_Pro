"[Verse 1] Long were the nights when My days once revolved around you Counting my footsteps Praying the floor won't fall through... again My mother accused me of losing my mind But I swore I was fine You paint me a blue sky Then go back and turn it to rain And I lived in your chess game But you changed the rules everyday Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why [Chorus] Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I shoulda known [Verse 2] Well maybe it's me And my blind optimism to blame Or maybe it's you and your sick need To give love and take it away And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors Who don't understand And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said ""Run as fast as you can"" [Chorus] Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance.

"We were both young when I first saw you. I close my eyes and the flashback starts: I'm standing there On a balcony in summer air. See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns, See you make your way through the crowd, And say, ""Hello."" Little did I know... That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet."" And I was crying on the staircase Begging you, ""Please don't go."" And I said, ""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."" So, I sneak out to the garden to see you. We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew. So, close your eyes, Escape this town for a little while. Oh, oh. 'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter. And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet."" But you were everything to me. I was begging you, ""Please don't go!"" And I said, ""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'. Romeo, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel. This love is difficult but it's real. Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."" Oh, oh, oh. I got tired of waiting, Wondering if you were ever coming around. My faith in you was fading, When I met you on the outskirts of town. And I said, ""Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone. I keep waiting for you, but you never come. Is this in my head? I don't know what to think."" He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said, ""Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone I love you, and that's all I really know. I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress. It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."" Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you."
"We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January This is our place, we make the rules And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years? Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close forever and ever? And ah, take me out and take me home You're my, my, my, my Lover We could let our friends crash in the living room This is our place, we make the call And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close forever and ever? And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever) You're my, my, my, my Lover Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand? With every guitar string scar on my hand I take this magnetic force of a man to be my Lover My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue All's well that ends well to end up with you Swear to be over-dramatic and true to my Lover And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me And at every table, I'll save you a seat Lover Can I go where you go? Can we always be this close forever and ever? And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever) You're my, my, my, my Oh, you're my, my, my, my Darling, you're my, my, my, my Lover"
"What did you think I'd say to that? Does a scorpion sting when fighting back? They strike to kill and you know I will You know I will What do you sing on your drive home? Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn? Does she smile? Or does she mouth ""fuck you forever""? Every time you call me crazy I get more crazy What about that? And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry And there's nothing like a mad woman What a shame she went mad No one likes a mad woman You made her like that And you'll poke that bear till her claws come out And you find something to wrap your noose around And there's nothing like a mad woman Now I breathe flames each time I talk My cannons all firing at your yacht They say ""move on"" But you know I won't And women like hunting witches, too Doing your dirtiest work for you It's obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together Every time you call me crazy I get more crazy What about that? And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry And there's nothing like a mad woman What a shame she went mad No one likes a mad woman You made her like that And you'll poke that bear till her claws come out And you find something to wrap your noose around And there's nothing like a mad woman I'm taking my time Taking my time 'Cause you took everything from me Watching you climb Watching you climb Over people like me The master of spin Has a couple side flings Good wives always know She should be mad Should be scathing like me But no one likes a mad woman What a shame she went mad You made her like that"
"You, with your words like knives And swords and weapons that you use against me You have knocked me off my feet again Got me feeling like a nothing You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard Calling me out when I'm wounded You, picking on the weaker man Well you can take me down with just one single blow But you don't know, what you don't know... Someday I'll be living in a big old city And all you're ever gonna be is mean Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean? You, with your switching sides And your wildfire lies and your humiliation You have pointed out my flaws again As if I don't already see them I walk with my head down Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you I just wanna feel okay again I bet you got pushed around Somebody made you cold But the cycle ends right now 'Cause you can't lead me down that road And you don't know, what you don't know... Someday I'll be living in a big old city And all you're ever gonna be is mean Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean? And I can see you years from now in a bar Talking over a football game With that same big loud opinion But nobody's listening Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing But all you are is mean All you are is mean And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean But someday I'll be living in a big old city And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so?... Someday I'll be living in a big old city (Why you gotta be so?...) And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...) Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...) And all you're ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so mean?"
"You were in college working part time waiting tables, Left a small town, never looked back. I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin' Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts. I say, ""Can you believe it?"" As we're lying on the couch The moment I can see it. Yes, yes, I can see it now. Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine. Flash forward and we're taking on the world together, And there's a drawer of my things at your place. You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded, You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes. But we got bills to pay, We got nothing figured out, When it was hard to take, Yes, yes, this is what I thought about. Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine. Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time. You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter. You are the best thing that's ever been mine. And I remember that fight, Two-thirty AM, As everything was slipping right out of our hands. I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street. Braced myself for the ""Goodbye"" 'Cause that's all I've ever known. Then you took me by surprise. You said, ""I'll never leave you alone."" You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water. And every time I look at you, it's like the first time. I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter. She is the best thing that's ever been mine."" Hold on, make it last. Hold on, never turn back. (Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine. (Hold on) Do you believe it? (Hold on) We're gonna make it now. (Hold on) And I can see it, (Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now)"

Cursing my name Wishing I'd stayed Look at how my tears ricochet And I can go anywhere I want Anywhere I want Just not home And you can aim for my heart, go for blood But you would still miss me in your bones And I still talk to you When I'm screaming at the sky And when you can't sleep at night You hear my stolen lullabies I didn't have it in myself to go with grace And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same Cursing my name Wishing I stayed You turned into your worst fears And you're tossing out blame Drunk on this pain Crossing out the good years And you're cursing my name Wishing I stayed Look at how my tears ricochet"

"I was riding shotgun With my hair undone In the front seat of his car He's got a one-hand feel On the steering wheel The other on my heart I look around, turn the radio down He says, ""Baby is something wrong?"" I say, ""Nothing I was just thinking How we don't have a song"" And he says... [Chorus:] Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window When we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know Our song is the way you laugh The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have."" And when I got home ... 'fore I said, ""Amen"" Asking God if he could play it again I was walking up The front porch steps After everything that day Had gone all wrong And been trampled on And lost and thrown away Got to the hallway, Well, on my way To my lovin' bed I almost didn't notice All the roses And the note that said... Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window When we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know Our song is the way you laugh The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"" And when I got home ... 'fore I said, ""Amen"" Asking God if he could play it again I've heard every album, listened to the radio Waited for something to come along That was as good as our song... 'Cause our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window When we're on the phone and he talks real slow 'Cause it's late and his mama don't know Our song is the way he laughs The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have"" And when I got home ...

"Elevator buttons and morning air Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares But right now my time is theirs Seems like there's always someone who disapproves They'll judge it like they know about me and you And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do The jury's out, but my choice is you So don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard The stakes are high, the water's rough But this love is ours You never know what people have up their sleeves Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine And you'll say Don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard The stakes are high, the water's rough But this love is ours And it's not theirs to speculate If it's wrong and Your hands are tough But they are where mine belong and I'll fight their doubt and give you faith With this song for you 'Cause I love the gap between your teeth And I love the riddles that you speak And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored 'Cause my heart is yours So don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine And life makes love look hard Don't you worry your pretty little mind People throw rocks at things that shine But they can't take what's ours They can't take what's ours The stakes are high, the water's rough But this love is ours"

Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say About a beautiful boy who died And it's about to be Halloween You could be anything you wanted if you were still here I remember the last day when I kissed your face And whispered in your ear Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here You were my best four years What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you? What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into? And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through? What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you? Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here You were my best four years I remember your bare feet down the hallway I love you to the moon and back"

"I am not the kind of girl Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion But you are not the kind of boy Who should be marrying the wrong girl I sneak in and see your friends And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel And she is yelling at a bridesmaid Somewhere back inside a room Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry This is surely not what you thought it would be I lose myself in a daydream Where I stand and say [Chorus:] Don’t say ""Yes"", run away now I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door Don’t wait or say a single vow You need to hear me out And they said, ""Speak now."" Fond gestures are exchanged And the organ starts to play A song that sounds like a death march And I am hiding in the curtains It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen But I know you wish it was me, You wish it was me, Don’t you? [Chorus:] Don’t say ""Yes"", run away now, I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door. Don’t wait or say a single vow, You need to hear me out, And they said, ""Speak now."" Don’t say ""Yes"", run away now, I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door. Don’t wait or say a single vow, Your time is running out, And they said, ""Speak now."" Oh, la, la Oh, oh Say a single vow I hear the preacher say, ""Speak now or forever hold your peace."" There’s the silence, there’s my last chance. I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me. Horrified looks from everyone in the room But I’m only looking at you. I am not the kind of girl Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion But you are not the kind of boy Who should be marrying the wrong girl [Chorus:] So, don’t say ""Yes"", run away now, I’ll meet you when you’re out of the church at the back door. Don’t wait or say a single vow, You need to hear me out, And they said, ""Speak now."" And you say, ""Let’s run away now, I’ll meet you when I’m out of my tux at the back door. Baby, I didn’t say my vows, So glad you were around When they said, ""Speak now."""

I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad. But I think that it's best if we both stay. Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers, Who took all of their problems out on me. But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'. And I love you because you have given me no choice but to... Stay, stay, stay. I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.

"You should've been there, Should've burst through the door, With that 'baby I'm right here' smile, And it would've felt like, A million little shining stars had just aligned, And I would've been so happy. Christmas lights glisten, I've got my eye on the door, Just waiting for you to walk in, But the time is ticking, People ask me how I've been As I comb back through my memory, How you said you'd be here, You said you'd be here. And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With no one to impress, And they're all laughing, As I'm looking around the room, But there's one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew. And the hours pass by, Now I just wanna be alone, But your close friends always seem to know When there's something really wrong, So they follow me down the hall, And there in the bathroom, I try not to fall apart, And the sinking feeling starts, As I say hopelessly, ""He said he'd be here."" And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With no one to impress, And they're all laughing, And asking me about you, But there was one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew. What do you say When tears are streaming down your face In front of everyone you know? And what do you do when the one Who means the most to you Is the one who didn't show? You should've been here. And I would've been so happy. And it was like slow motion, Standing there in my party dress, In red lipstick, With no one to impress, And they're all standing around me singing ""Happy birthday to you"", But there was one thing missing, And that was the moment I knew. Ooh, I knew. Ooh, You called me later, And said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"" And I said, ""I'm sorry too,"" And that was the moment I knew."
"In the heat of the fight I walked away Ignoring words that you were saying Trying to make me stay I said, ""This time I've had enough."" And you've called a hundred times But I'm not picking up 'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over But if you look a little closer I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you To stand outside my window throwing pebbles Screaming, ""I'm in love with you."" Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more And don't you leave 'cause I know All I need is on the other side of the door Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone Going through the photographs, staring at the phone I keep going back over things we both said And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see When I left I wanted you to chase after me Yeah, I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you To stand outside my window throwing pebbles Screaming, ""I'm in love with you."" Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more And don't you leave 'cause I know All I need is on the other side of the door And I'll scream out the window I can't even look at you I don't need you but I do, I do, I do I say, ""There's nothing you can say to make this right again. I mean it, I mean it."" What I mean is... I said, ""Leave,"" but baby all I want is you To stand outside my window throwing pebbles Screaming, ""I'm in love with you."" Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more And don't you leave 'cause I know All I need is on the other side of the door With your face and the beautiful eyes And the conversation with the little white lies And the faded picture of a beautiful night You carry me from your car up the stairs And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess? After everything and that little black dress After everything I must confess, I need you"
"I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us, How we met and the sparks flew instantly, And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones."" I used to know my place was the spot next to you. Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat, 'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on. Oh, a simple complication, Miscommunications lead to fall-out. So many things that I wish you knew. So many walls up I can't break through. Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking. And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah? I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down, And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. Next chapter. How'd we end up this way? See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy, And you're doing your best to avoid me. I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us, How I was losing my mind when I saw you here, But you held your pride like you should've held me. Oh, I'm scared to see the ending, Why are we pretending this is nothing? I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how. I've never heard silence quite this loud. Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking. And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah? I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down, And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. This is looking like a contest Of who can act like they care less, But I liked it better when you were on my side. The battle's in your hands now, But I would lay my armour down If you said you'd rather love than fight. So many things that you wish I knew, But the story of us might be ending soon. Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking. And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah? But I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down, And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now. ...and we're not speaking. And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah? I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down, And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.

And you've got a smile That could light up this whole town. I haven't seen it in a while Since she brought you down. You say you're fine I know you better than that. Hey, what you doing with a girl like that? She wears high heels, I wear sneakers. She's cheer captain, And I'm on the bleachers.

It's 7 AM"" Say it in the street, that's a knock-out But you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out And I'm just like, ""Hey! Are you OK?"" And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression But I've learned the lesson That stressing and obsessing 'Bout somebody else is no fun And snakes and stones never broke my bones So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh! You need to calm down You're being too loud And I'm just like ""Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh! You need to just stop Like, can you just not step on my gown? You need to calm down"" You are somebody that we don't know But you're coming at my friends like a missile Why are you mad When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD) Sunshine on the street at the parade But you would rather be in the dark ages Just making that sign Must've taken all night You just need to take several seats And then try to restore the peace And control your urges to scream About all the people you hate 'Cause shade never made anybody less gay So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh! You need to calm down You're being too loud And I'm just like ""Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh! You need to just stop Like, can you just not step on his gown You need to calm down"" And we see you over there on the Internet Comparing all the girls who are killing it But we figured you out We all know now We all got crowns You need to calm down Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh! You need to calm down (You need to calm down) You're being too loud (You're being too loud) And I'm just like ""Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh! You need to just stop (Can you stop?) Like, can you just not step on our gowns You need to calm down"""
"All this time I was wasting Hoping you would come around I've been giving out chances every time And all you do is let me down And it's taken me this long Baby but I figured you out And you're thinking we'll be fine again But not this time around You don't have to call anymore I won't pick up the phone This is the last straw Don't wanna hurt anymore And you can tell me that you're sorry But I don't believe you baby Like I did before You're not sorry... no, no, no, no You are looking so innocent I might believe you if I didn't know Could've loved you all my life If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold And you got your share of secrets And I'm tired of being last to know And now you're asking me to listen Cause it's worked each time before But you don't have to call anymore I won't pick up the phone This is the last straw Don't wanna hurt anymore And you can tell me that you're sorry But I don't believe you baby Like I did before You're not sorry... no, no, no You're not sorry... no, no, no You had me crawling for you honey And it never would've gone away, no You used to shine so bright But I watched all of it fade So you don't have to call anymore I won't pick up the phone This is the last straw There's nothing left to beg for And you can tell me that you're sorry But I don't believe you baby Like I did before You're not sorry... no, no, no You're not sorry... no, no, no No, no, no, no No, no, no, no No, no, no, no"
